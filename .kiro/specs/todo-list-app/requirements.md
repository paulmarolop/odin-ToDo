# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a web-based ToDo List application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently across multiple projects. The application will be built using modern JavaScript with a modular architecture, separating business logic from DOM manipulation. The project will use Webpack for bundling, npm for package management, and external libraries like date-fns for date handling. Data will be persisted using localStorage for client-side storage. Users will be able to create detailed tasks with multiple properties (title, description, due date, priority, notes, and checklists), organize them into different projects, and manage them through an intuitive web interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create detailed tasks with comprehensive information, so that I can track all aspects of what needs to be accomplished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL allow input for title, description, due date, priority, notes, and checklist items
2. WHEN the user enters a task title AND clicks "Add" or presses Enter THEN the system SHALL create a new task with the provided information
3. WHEN the user attempts to create a task without a title THEN the system SHALL prevent task creation and display a validation message
4. WHEN a new task is created THEN the system SHALL assign it to the currently selected project
5. WHEN creating a task THEN the system SHALL allow the user to set priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
6. WHEN creating a task THEN the system SHALL allow the user to add multiple checklist items as sub-tasks
7. WHEN a task is created THEN the system SHALL clear the input form and display the task in the current project's task list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my tasks with their detailed information in a organized format, so that I can see what needs to be done at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display all tasks for the currently selected project in a vertical list format
2. WHEN tasks exist THEN the system SHALL display each task showing title, due date, priority level, and completion status
3. WHEN the user clicks on a task THEN the system SHALL expand to show full details including description, notes, and checklist items
4. WHEN no tasks exist in the current project THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the project is empty
5. WHEN tasks are added or modified THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
6. WHEN displaying tasks THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for priority levels and overdue items

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete or incomplete, so that I can track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a task's checkbox THEN the system SHALL toggle the task's completion status
2. WHEN a task is marked as complete THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish it from incomplete tasks (e.g., strikethrough text, different color)
3. WHEN a task is marked as incomplete THEN the system SHALL restore its normal appearance
4. WHEN the completion status changes THEN the system SHALL persist the change

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete tasks I no longer need, so that I can keep my list clean and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a delete button for a task THEN the system SHALL remove the task from the list
2. WHEN a task is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
3. WHEN the user attempts to delete a task THEN the system SHALL provide a clear delete action (button or icon)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing tasks and their detailed properties, so that I can correct mistakes or update task information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks an edit button for a task THEN the system SHALL open an edit form with all task properties
2. WHEN the user is editing a task THEN the system SHALL allow modification of title, description, due date, priority, notes, and checklist items
3. WHEN the user saves changes THEN the system SHALL update the task and persist the changes
4. WHEN the user cancels editing THEN the system SHALL restore the original task data
5. WHEN the user attempts to save a task without a title THEN the system SHALL prevent the save and show a validation message
6. WHEN editing checklist items THEN the system SHALL allow adding, removing, and modifying individual checklist items

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my tasks to persist between browser sessions, so that I don't lose my data when I close and reopen the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds, modifies, or deletes tasks THEN the system SHALL save the changes to local storage
2. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display previously saved tasks
3. WHEN local storage is not available THEN the system SHALL still function but inform the user that data won't persist

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize my tasks into different projects, so that I can separate work, personal, and other categories of tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first loads the application THEN the system SHALL create a "Default" project and display it as the active project
2. WHEN the user wants to create a new project THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add a new project with a custom name
3. WHEN the user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL add it to the project list and make it available for selection
4. WHEN the user selects a different project THEN the system SHALL switch the view to show only tasks belonging to that project
5. WHEN the user creates a task THEN the system SHALL assign it to the currently active project
6. WHEN the user wants to move a task between projects THEN the system SHALL provide an option to reassign the task to a different project
7. WHEN the user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL move all tasks from that project to the Default project
8. WHEN displaying projects THEN the system SHALL show the project name and task count for each project

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage checklist items within tasks, so that I can break down complex tasks into smaller actionable steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds checklist items to a task THEN the system SHALL display them as individual checkboxes within the task
2. WHEN the user checks off a checklist item THEN the system SHALL mark it as complete and update the task's overall progress
3. WHEN all checklist items are completed THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication of full checklist completion
4. WHEN the user adds or removes checklist items THEN the system SHALL update the task's progress indicator accordingly
5. WHEN displaying a task with checklist items THEN the system SHALL show the completion ratio (e.g., "3/5 items completed")

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have a clean modular architecture, so that business logic is separated from DOM manipulation and the code is maintainable.

1. WHEN implementing the application THEN the system SHALL separate business logic (task creation, completion, priority changes) into dedicated modules
2. WHEN implementing the application THEN the system SHALL separate DOM manipulation and UI rendering into dedicated modules
3. WHEN implementing the application THEN the system SHALL use a clear module structure with defined interfaces between components

5. WHEN implementing the application THEN the system SHALL use ES6 modules for code organization

### Requirement 10

6. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL optimize and minify the bundled output

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be stored locally on my computer, so that I can access my tasks without requiring an internet connection or external server.

#### Acceptance Criteria
